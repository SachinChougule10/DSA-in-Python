# DSA in Python 🐍🚀

This repository contains my solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms**
implemented in **Python**.  
I use this repo to practice core DSA concepts and strengthen my
problem-solving skills for technical interviews.

## 📌 What this repository includes
- Topic-wise DSA problem solutions
- Clean, readable, and well-structured Python code
- Emphasis on both brute-force and optimized approaches
- Regular updates as I continue learning and practicing

---

## 📂 Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Basic Problems
- Binary Search
- Matrix
- Recursion
- Sorting
- Hashing

> Some topics are revisited later with more advanced problems as learning progresses.
