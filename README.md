# DSA in Python 🐍🚀

This repository contains my solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms**
implemented in **Python**.  
I use this repo to practice core DSA concepts and strengthen my
problem-solving skills for technical interviews.

---

## 📌 What this repository includes
- Topic-wise DSA problem solutions
- Problems from **LeetCode (LC)** and **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**
- Question number and platform mentioned inside each file
- Clean, readable, and well-structured Python code
- Emphasis on both brute-force and optimized approaches
- Detailed logic explanation provided at the end of every file
- Regular updates as I continue learning and practicing

## 📂 Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Basic Problems
- Binary Search
- Matrix
- Recursion
- Sorting
- Hashing
- Linked List (Singly)

> Some topics are revisited later with more advanced problems as learning progresses.

## 🚧 Current Focus
- 📍 Actively uploading **Singly Linked List** problems  
- 📍 Currently learning **Doubly Linked List**  
- 📍 Other topics will be expanded gradually

## 🧩 Note
- This repository reflects my **learning journey in DSA**.  
- Each solution includes the problem reference and explanation for better conceptual clarity.  
- Topics are updated progressively and not completed all at once.
